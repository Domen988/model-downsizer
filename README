Folder copy machine. Copy by preset rules. Scheduling.

Model downsizer is a C# windows forms application used for copying complex, structured folders and files based on predefined rules. Originally created for copying Tekla Structures model folders (structural engineering software).

Rules function like sets of 'equal' or 'does not equal' filters. Folder or file names and file extensions can be used for filtering. There are some special filters with more complex functionality, which come in handy when Model Downsizer is used for copying Tekla Structures model folders.

Rules are in the form of.txt files and can be created in application. How-to is included in rule's header.

Functionality:

    * copy folders based on rules,
    
    * create preset for quick execution of frequent copy jobs,
    
    * create scheduled copy jobs.
