Model downsizer is a C# windows forms application used for copying structured folders and files based on predefined rules. Originally created for copying Tekla Structures model folders.

Rules function like sets of 'equal' or 'does not equal' filters. Folder or file names and file extensions can be used for filtering. There are some special filters with more complex functionality, for specific Tekla structures files.

Rules are in the form of.txt files and can be created in application. How-to is included in rule's header.

Functionality:

    * copy folders based on filters,
    
    * presets for quick execution of frequent copy jobs,
    
    * create scheduled copy jobs.
